##From a thread in the Issues section
==============

My whole reason for re-packaging this awesome blog package was cause our front page [Linkwok], is built using Meteor and we are using [FlowRouter] for routing. I wanted to add the blog capability. You can see it in action at [Linkwok Blog]. The existing package used [Iron Router] so I chose to update it. 

IMHO FlowRouter is a massively elegant way of routing in Meteor as compared to [Iron Router] which has gotten incredibly bloated. Granted FlowRouter does not work on older browsers that don't have [Push State] support so it just won't work on IE9 etc. - period - but it is incredibly more efficient and lightweight. It handles subscriptions etc. way better and [Arunoda] & Team at [MeteorHacks] have really overcome the issues that we have faced with Iron Router in the past. 


Fundamentally, the changes are as follows:

 - Using [FlowRouter] by MeteorHacks in place of [Iron Router]. 
 - Allowing users to add an image for each article - i.e. a core picture for every article that appears on the list of articles. 

##I will update this Readme and the package so it is far more efficient and more "plug & play" over the coming weeks.

##Installation

`> meteor add xolvio:md-blog`

##Getting Started

There are a couple of steps to carry out before you can start using this package. Don't worry
it's very easy!

### 1. Define Layouts
First you need to define two templates that the blog in your app that look like this:

```html
<template name="blogListLayout">
  {{> yield}}
</template>

<template name="blogPostLayout">
  {{> yield}}
</template>
```

These are iron-router layouts that you be available at `<your site>/blog` and `<your site>/blog/:_id/:slug`.

You may want to customize these template further like adding disqus for instance:

```html
<template name="blogPostLayout">
  {{> yield}}
  {{> disqus}}
</template>
```

### 2. Setup Accounts & Roles
You need to ensure you are using a Meteor accounts package like accounts-password, and that the
user you are logged has 'roles' array with the element `mdblog-author`. Here's an example of a
user object:

```json
{
  "_id": "ixoreoJY5wzmNYMcY",
  "emails": [ {
    "address" : "sam@xolv.io",
    "verified" : true
  } ],
  "profile": { "name" : "Sam Hatoum" },
  "roles": [ "mdblog-author" ]
}
```

You can also the above pragmatically by calling
`Roles.addUsersToRoles(user._id, ['mdblog-author']);`

For more information about roles, have a look at the
[alanning:roles](https://github.com/alanning/meteor-roles) package.


You're ready to go!

### 3. Customize

This blog is designed to be fully customizable and as unopinionated as possible. Here are some of
the ways you can configure it.

####Styling

To style the blog list and posts, apply css
[just like in the demo app](https://github.com/xolvio/md-blog/blob/master/app/client/blog/blog.less).

For syntax highlighting style, you need to add the hljs css file of your choice.
[Pick a css template from here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/). You can see this in the
demo app,
[there is a file named hljs.css](https://github.com/xolvio/md-blog/tree/master/app/client/blog).

####Custom Classes
You can also add classes to any element of your choice! For this you need to use the settings.json
file. Have a look at the settings.json file below. You can see there's a field named
`element-classes`. The example above is adding the class
`pure-img` to all `img` elements. This is very powerful as it allows you to use your CSS
framework of your choice.

####Sorting
By default, the blog sorts your posts by date. You can change this by modifying the `sortBy`
field in the settings file.

####Blog Routes

The blog runs at the default "/blog" route. The archive runs at the default
"/blog/archive" route. For each post, the default is the "blog/:shortId/:slug" route. You can customize where the blog handles requests by
changing the `blogPath` and `archivePath`. You can also remove the short id from the blog post path by setting the `useUniqueBlogPostsPath` to false.

####Settings File Example
```json
{
  "public": {
    "blog": {
      "name": "The Xolv.io md-blog",
      "Description": "Get verbal on your websites.",
      "prettify": {
        "syntax-highlighting": true,
        "element-classes": [
          {
            "locator": "img",
            "classes": ["pure-img"]
          },
          {
            "locator": "button",
            "classes": ["pure-button"]
          }
        ]
      },
      "sortBy": {"date": -1},
      "blogPath": "/blog",
      "archivePath": "/blog/archive",
      "useUniqueBlogPostsPath": true
    }
  }
}
```

####i18n
The blog engine can be configured to display messages and button texts in any language.
English is the default language, and translations are provided for the French language.
Specify `defaultLocale` at the same level as the blog name, in the `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "public": {
    "blog": {
      ...
      "defaultLocale": "fr"
    }
  }
}
```
**How do I change the language depending on my user's preference?**

  Simply call `Session.set('locale', newLocale)`

**I need translations for a new language!**
- Refer to the `tap:i18n` package [documentation](https://github.com/TAPevents/tap-i18n#documentation--examples). You should take a look at the sample app first.
- There are two ways to provide additional languages: 1. the preferred way is to submit a Pull Request to integrate the new `i18n/<locale>.i18n.json`. 2. The other way is to place this file in your Meteor application.
- When adding a new language, you will also want to configure Moment to display the localized version of `today at hh:mm` and other such texts. This is done through the `moment` object in the i18n bundle (`i18n/language.i18n.json`).
  The following example sets the days and months in French, and configures a few moments in French as well.
  (Note that this is not comprehensive. Refer to the [Moment documentation](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/changing-locale/) for more settings.)
  Due to `tap:i18n` only supporting Strings and not Objects in its bundles, you have to use a JSON string. The JSON string may be broken down into an array of Strings for better readability.

  As an example, in order to get:
```json
  "moment": {
    "weekdays": [ "lundi", "mardi", "mercredi", "jeudi", "vendredi", "samedi", "dimanche" ],
    "calendar": {
      "lastDay": "[hier à] LT",
      "sameDay": "[aujourd'hui à] LT",
      "nextDay": "[demain à] LT",
      "lastWeek": "[dernier] dddd [à] LT",
      "nextWeek": "dddd [à] LT",
      "sameElse": "DD/MM/YYYY"
    }
  }
```
  You need to write:
`// in app/i18n/language.i18n.json:`
```json
  "moment": [
    "{",
    "\"weekdays\": [ \"lundi\", \"mardi\", \"mercredi\", \"jeudi\", \"vendredi\", \"samedi\", \"dimanche\" ],",
    "\"calendar\": {",
      "\"lastDay\": \"[hier à] LT\",",
      "\"sameDay\": \"[aujourd'hui à] LT\",",
      "\"nextDay\": \"[demain à] LT\",",
      "\"lastWeek\": \"dddd [dernier à] LT\",",
      "\"nextWeek\": \"dddd [à] LT\",",
      "\"sameElse\": \"DD/MM/YYYY\"",
      "}",
    "}"
  ]
```

####Send an email when a new post is published
1. Set `emailOnPublish` to true:
```json
{
  "public": {
    "blog": {
      ...
      "emailOnPublish": "true"
    }
  }
}
```
2. Run `meteor add meteorhacks:ssr` to add the SSR package.
3. Provide a compiled template named `publishEmail`. For example, if the `publish_email.html` template sits in the `private` directory, make sure to run:
```
  SSR.compileTemplate('publishEmail',
    Assets.getText('publish_email.html'));
```

An email will be sent to all registered users (in Bcc) when a post is published. Its sender will be the post's author. Its title will be the post's title. Its body will come from the `publishEmail` template. The template should contain the blog post's `summary` and its `url`. Example:
```
<h2>{{summary}}</h2>
<a href="{{url}}">Read more...</a>
```

####Configure pictures max size and Slingshot directive
To understand how to configure `edgee:slingshot`, read [its documentation](https://github.com/CulturalMe/meteor-slingshot/#aws-s3).
```json
{
  "public": {
    "blog": {
      ...
      "pictures": {
        "maxWidth": "800",
        "maxHeight": "800",
        "Slingshot": {
          "directive": "<directive name>"
          }
        }
    }
  }
}
```
The demo app will work with Google Cloud Storage if you provide a `pem` file and a file that contains the `GoogleAccessId` as Assets (under the `private` directory).:
```json
{
  "public": {
    "blog": {
      ...
      "pictures": {
        "Slingshot": {
          "pemFile": "google-cloud-service-key.pem",
          "idTextFile": "google-cloud-access-id.txt"
          }
        }
    }
  }
}
```


##Additional Info

###URL Format
The URL format of your blog will look like this:

`www.your-site.com/blog`

`www.your-site.com/blog/7yh22/your-latest-blog-post`

The format is `/:_id/:slug`

The `:slug` is the title of the blog post with all the spaces replaced with dashes. It's believed
this is good for SEO purposes.

The `:_id` is a truncated version of the mongo id for the blog entry. This allows you to have
multiple posts with the same title over time.

When you archive blog posts, currently they are removed from the main view but they are still
accessible by search engines and external links. To see your archived blog entries, go to:

`www.your-site.com/archive`

###Environment Variables

If you want the app to delete all the blog entries on startup, set the environment variable
`AUTO_RESET=1` when running meteor. For example:

```bash
AUTO_RESET=1 meteor
```
